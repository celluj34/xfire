To Compile
==========

*NOTES*
~~~~~~~
gaim-xfire-0.1 will work with gaim 1.3.0


Next run the configure script.  If you have extracted gaim-xfire with in
the GAIM_SRC_DIR/plugins the script should auto detect where the Gaim source
is. Otherwise, just add --with-gaim=PATH/TO/GAIM, this must be an absolute
path, if someone wants to fix this up and have it work for both absolute and
relative paths, feel free.

  ./configure --with-gaim=/PATH/TO/GAIM --prefix=/usr
  
--prefix=/usr could be something else, but for most people it is /usr
As long as you haven't gotten any error messages during the configure script,
you'll be read to compile.  To compile just type 'make':
  
  make
  
gaim-xfire will install to the gaim lib directory and the button image
into the gaim datadir.  These directories are usually /usr/local/lib/gaim and
/usr/local/share/pixmaps/gaim, so be sure you have write access to these
directories, or use 'su' to become root and then run 'make install':

  make install

Once thats done, you are good to go.  Restart Gaim, go into accounts, then
to "Add".  You can now add an account for Xfire. Create a account on www.xfire.com if needed.
