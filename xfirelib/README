DOCUMENTATION

  Please visit http://xfirelib.sphene.net for further documentation
  (tutorials, API, etc.), bug reports and forums.

REQUIREMENTS:

  To compile xfirelib you will need jam:
    http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html
  It also requires pthreads support.

COMPILING:

  Just run 'jam' in the root directory of xfirelib.

TESTING:

  To test if the build was successful you can execute the testclient:
  bin/testclient/xfirelibtest

INSTALLING:

  You can run 'jam install' to install headers and libxfirelib.a
  (Please note that the install process is not perfect yet, and you 
   can't choose a target directory for libxfirelib.a)
  Anyway, you can always run 'jam uninstall' to remove all installed 
  files.

IN ACTION:

  Beside the xfiretestclient xfirelib is used by 'xfiregateway'
  a gateway between jabber and xfire. Visit
  http://xfirelib.sphene.net/wiki/show/XFireGateway for more 
  information.
